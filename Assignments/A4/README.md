## Assignment 4: Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance

Read assignment for full details, but in short:

1. Make sure you're set up with an account on Roar and create a custom Jupyter envionment with the packages necessary to analyze these data. Follow directions here: https://github.com/trusel/GEOG497-SP22/tree/main/Roar
2. Plot, analyze, and diagnose recent SMB changes for the Greenland ice sheet. 
3. If your code breaks and you can't figure out what happened, you can always copy and paste the code from here into your Jupyter notebook on Roar.
