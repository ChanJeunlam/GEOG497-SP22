# Geography 497 - Cryosphere and Climate Systems
**Penn State University - Spring 2022**

### Overview 

This github repository hosts some course material associated with Geography 497 - Cryosphere and Climate Systems at Penn State. These materials were developed by Luke Trusel for the initial offering of the class in the spring 2021 semester. The class is offered as an upper-level elective. For spring 2022, the enrollment is entirely undergraduates majoring in various earth science fields.

This course has a focus on the evolution, interactions, and feedbacks between ice sheets and the climate system over a range of timescales from past to future. Emphasis is placed on the analysis of climate and cryospheric datasets, and more broadly on working with data and thinking analytically as fundamental, transferrable skills. There are no formal pre-requisites for the class. Exercises therefore also serve as an introduction to working with tabular, gridded, and multi-dimensional datasets, and developing geospatial analytical skillsets. 

### Exploring code and data in the cloud
Code here can be explored in an interactive JupyterLab interface via Binder:

However, given the size of some datasets being used in the assignments, not all work in Binder.

#### What works (via Binder)
* Examples: Intro to python/jupyter/pandas using cryosphere and climate datasets.
* Assignment 3: Exploring the f√∂hn effect on Larsen C via weather station data and regional climate model output

#### What doesn't work (via Binder)
 * Assignment 4: GrIS SMB. This assignment reads large RCM datasets stored locally on the [Penn State Roar Supercomputer](https://github.com/trusel/GEOG497-SP22/tree/main/Roar).
