# Geography 497 - Cryosphere and Climate Systems
**Penn State University - Spring 2021**

### Overview 

This github repository hosts some course material associated with Geography 497 - Cryosphere and Climate Systems at Penn State. These materials were developed by Luke Trusel for the initial offering of the class in the spring 2021 semester. The class is offered as an upper-level elective and for the spring 2021 semester had equal enrollment between undergrads and first year grad students. 

This course has a focus on the evolution, interactions, and feedbacks between ice sheets and the climate system over a range of timescales from past to future. Emphasis is placed on the analysis of climate and cryospheric datasets, and more broadly on working with data and thinking analytically as fundamental, transferrable skills. As of the initial offering, there are no formal pre-requisites for the class. Exercises therefore also serve as an introduction to working with tabular, gridded, and multi-dimensional datasets, and developing geospatial analytical skillsets. 

### Exploring code and data in the cloud
Code here can be explored in an interactive JupyterLab interface via Binder:

However, given the size of some datasets being used in the assignments, not all work in Binder.

#### What works
* A3: Exploring the f√∂hn effect on Larsen C via weather station data and regional climate model output

#### What doesn't work
* A4: Assessing change and drivers of Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance
  - Data for A4 are too large for Binder/Github, and therefore this assignment has students work on Penn State's Institute for Computational and Data Sciences Roar computing environment.
