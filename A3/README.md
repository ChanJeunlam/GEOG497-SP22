## Assignment 3: Föhn winds driving Larsen C melt

Read assignment for full details, but in short:

1. First identify the longest duration föhn-related melt event at AWS18 using the FöhnDA method.
  - In class, we originally showed how this is possiible with Excel (i.e., the lowest common denominator data analysis suite for the class). Later, I demonstrated how using the `pandas` data analysis library is a more elegant, and likely easier solution. The notebook [`A3_Pandas_and_FohnDA.ipynb`](https://github.com/trusel/GEOG497/blob/main/A3/A3_Pandas_and_FohnDA.ipynb) contains this demonstration. 
3. Next, assess the impacts on the SEB using 5.5-km RACMO2.3p2 output in [`A3_GEOG497_RACMO_SEB.ipynb`](https://github.com/trusel/GEOG497/blob/main/A3/A3_GEOG497_RACMO_SEB.ipynb).
4. Determine whether the föhn effect is well represented in the 27-km version of RACMO2.3p2 in [`A3_GEOG497_RACMO_Melt.ipynb`](https://github.com/trusel/GEOG497/blob/main/A3/A3_GEOG497_RACMO_Melt.ipynb).

Make sure to save your plots and download your edited Jupyter Notebook before closing the Binder, as you will lose all work once you exit.
