## Assignment 3: Föhn winds driving Larsen C melt

Read assignment for full details, but in short:

1. First identify the longest duration föhn-related melt event at AWS18 using the FöhnDA method.
2. Next, assess the impacts on the SEB using 5.5-km RACMO2.3p2 output in `A3_GEOG497_RACMO_SEB.ipynb`.
3. Determine whether the föhn effect is well represented in the 27-km version of RACMO2.3p2 in `A3_GEOG497_RACMO_Melt.ipynb`.

Make sure to save your plots and download your edited Jupyter Notebook before closing the Binder, as you will lose all work once you exit.
